It's been 3 weeks since the Autumn Blitz concluded, where we saw the invited favourites in Overt take out the underdogs of Clarity ESC in a clean sweep fashion. Now it's time to focus what's next for BlueBird Rivals. Yesterday, we already announced that the Weekly Bash would be turned into a stand-alone event with seasons and a finale but for our next seasonal circuit, it time for another brawl with the 'Winter Brawl', with a frosty $600 AUD+ prize pool.

We have decided to expand upon the 'back to basics' approach from the Autumn Blitz, where the Winter Brawl will now focus on the quality of games, an easy to follow format and content and coverage on the teams and games. There will be 3 stages to the event 2 weeks of Qualifiers, 4 weeks for the Premier Stage and a Finale.

## Qualifiers
_Friday June 25 and July 2_

As part of making the Weekly Bash a fully independent event series, the Winter Brawl will have its own stand-alone qualifier system where the top 3 teams from each qualifier will progress to the Premier stage. Additionally, unlike other qualifiers we have ran in the past, the Winter Brawl qualifiers will end at the qualifying rounds (Upper and Lower Semi-Finals) as these qualifiers are purely qualifiers and is not a weekly event.

## Premier Stage
_Every Thursday from July 15 to August 5_

6 teams will go head to head in a single round robin for 4 weeks. We wanted every game to be seen, by making this stage 4 weeks long, it allows everyone to witness all the games that format brings, but it allows for teams to study their opponents more easily with less games being played each night. For the final week of the Premier Stage, we will be having a 'Super Night', where there will be 6 games (split across 2 streams) played out. The top 4 from this stage will progress to the Finale. Also for the 5th and 6th placing teams, they will both get $30 AUD at the end of the season.

## Finale
_Thursday August 12_

The top 4 teams will play in a new Page Playoff System tournament, battling it for their share in the $600 AUD prize pool. A page playoff system in a nutshell resembles a double elimination, but the top 2 teams will go to the upper bracket, while the bottom 2 teams will have to play in the lower bracket.

There will be hard battles to be played out and only one team at the end of the night can declare themselves the Winter Brawl victors and join Max's Rancid Rats and Overt as a BlueBird Rivals seasonal circuit victor.

### Autumn PREMIER - March 28 to April 20 (subject to change)

For those not in the 'Autumn PREMIER', we still want to give a opportunity for everyone to make it to the Finale through our 'PREMIER Challengers Series' that will run at the same time as the 'Autumn PREMIER' Group Stage and the winner from each qualifier will go head to head with the bottom 2 from the 'Group Stage'.

### Age Limit

With the 'Rocket League Community Tournament Guidelines' being recently updated, we have lowered the minimum age limit to the age of '13'. With that change in mind, everyone is free to experiment with the next generation of talent within our community events.

### Caster Callout

Last but not least, we want to put a public callout to those that are interested in casting Rocket League events and want to get some volunteer experience. You'll get to have an opportunity to cast the ever great bubble scene filled with new and upcoming talent, along with established veterans of the scene. It doesn't matter if you're just starting to get into casting or if you're looking to refine your skills, we're willing to give more people the opportunity to make a name for themselves.

So our Valorant event plan hasn't exactly gone the way we wanted to, with us having to call off the original Frenzy Blitz event due to low attendance. So we have gone back drawing board to rework and reimagine our Valorant events for the rest of the year.

# Introducing the NEW Frenzy Blitz

The new Frenzy Blitz is a 3 part event series, where it will help us get to understand the Oceanic Valorant competitive community and give the community a different challenge for each episode throughout November and the start of December. We also decided to take on board some feedback and we have decided each episode of the Frenzy Blitz will be FREE ENTRY.

These are the dates and total prize pool for each episode:

> Ep.1 (Beginnings) - Sat November 6 ($150 AUD)

> Ep.2 (Evolution) - Sat November 20 ($150 AUD)

> Ep.3 (Max. LvL) - Sat December 4/Sun December 5 ($300 AUD)

Each episode will start at 4pm AEDT and registrations will close a day prior.

## More Details

Registrations for Episode 1 are NOW OPEN with limited spots available. Registrations for Episodes 2 and 3 will open once the previous event has concluded.

For more details please see <a target="_blank" rel=" noopener" class="ARhbh sn3Ek" href="https://www.bluebirdrivals.org/frenzyblitz">https://www.bluebirdrivals.org/frenzyblitz</a>.

We can't wait to see what the Valorant community show us.

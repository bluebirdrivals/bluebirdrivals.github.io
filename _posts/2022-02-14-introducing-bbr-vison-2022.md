Today is Valentines Day, a day of love and affection and over here at BlueBird Rivals, we run our events for the love of Esports and the Oceanic region. After a longer than expected break, we are BACK with our vision for the not so new year.

## Rocket League

2021 started off rocky for us with the Summer Brawl circuit, but we managed turn that start into a special year for us with Autumn Blitz, Winter & Spring Brawl and raising $5000 AUD for charity.

So in 2022, we want to transition away from a focus on providing weekly events to a focus on providing quality events with RISE and PREMIER and to create storylines, rivalries and a special feeling with these events.

### Autumn RISE - February 21 to March 21

BlueBird Rivals Rise is our new grassroot event series where we want to have players and teams to experiment, tinker and practice together in a tournament environment, while rewarding those that play well enough to join the Finale and play for their stake in the $150 AUD prize pool.

##### Format

_Monthly Tournament Format_

4 Qualifiers (Every Monday Feb 21 - Mar 14)
-   Double Elimination Groups to Single Elimination.
-   Top 8 will earn qualification points.
-   $30 AUD prize pool to the winner of each qualifier.
    
Top 8 Finale (Mar 21)
-   Double Elimination
-   Top 8 from the Points Qualification Leaderboard
-   $150 AUD Prize Pool (1st - $120 AUD, 2nd - $30 AUD)
-   Top 2 qualify to the Autumn Premier event.

### Autumn PREMIER - March 28 to April 20 (subject to change)

BlueBird Rivals Premier is our newest flagship event series designed to highlight the next generation of players and teams. Those who have yet to make a name of themselves in the OCE scene will be tested against each other in a structured environment.

Unfortunately, we cannot share too much about the Autumn Premier Series event, as we're still trying to fully understand the updated 'Rocket League Community Tournament Guidelines'. We'll have more to say in the coming weeks, once we have some more clarity.

### Age Limit

In order to comply with the recently updated 'Rocket League Community Tournament Guidelines', all of our Rocket League related events will require participants to be at least the age of 15. Those found participating in our event who do not meet the Age requirements, will be barred from participating in our future Rocket League event until they turn the age of 15.

We know this will upset those under the age of 15, as there are some people incredibly talented people in that age bracket and in the past some of these people got their start through these community tournaments and once they reached the age of 15, they would go on to join some top teams but unfortunately this one is out of our hands.

## Valorant

### Frenzy Blitz - To resume sometime in March or April

The Frenzy Blitz will return to kick off our Valorant events for 2022. This will be a two night, fortnightly event series with specifics on format, team caps and prize pools to be announced at a later date.

We will have more to say once we can lock in a definitive date to return to running BBR Valorant events, but expect to be similar to the Frenzy Blitz's from last year.

## What's Next?

There's a lot in the pipelines here at BlueBird Rivals with a third pillar to the BlueBird Rivals brand being worked on in the experimental phase that will provide an alternative to our Rocket League and Valorant events. We are also working on completely re-developing this website (we hope to reveal it soon) and working on transitioning our Valorant event to follow the same RISE and Premier event structure as our Rocket League.

We have 2022 split into three phases (we're currently in Phase 1) and we hope to update you with what's going with the other phases closer to when each of those phases are set to begin. With a lot going on at BlueBird Rivals, we hope you would care to join us in this journey and see just where 2022 takes us.

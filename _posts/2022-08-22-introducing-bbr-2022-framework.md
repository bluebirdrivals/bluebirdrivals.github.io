### Warm-Up Cups

With the next season of RLCS expected to come with in the coming months, we know that there is a demand for a series warm-up events heading into qualifying weekend.

That is why once the next season of RLCS begins, we will be aiming running a series of events that will run on the Wednesday of each open qualifying weekend with a $30 AUD prize pool to help everyone warm-up for the weekend. But that is all subject to change depending on how the next RLCS season shapes up to be.

_More information about our Rocket League events for the rest of 2022 including the rulebook can be found in our framework document._ [_https://bit.ly/3T0NoZn_](https://bit.ly/3T0NoZn)

_(Please note that this document may change regularly, so keep an eye out on the document from time to time)_

## VALORANT - 2022 FRAMEWORK

Earlier this year, we had planned to return to running Valorant events with the resumption of the Frenzy Blitz events. However this did not come to fruition due to a variety of reasons.

We do not want to let go of the community that we built up last year and we are seeking community feedback to gaze interest and demand for us to run events again with our target audience in mind (the bubble scene). If it turns out there is enough demand and if feasible, then we will develop a framework based on that feedback and interest and will have more to say when the time comes.

If you want to see us run Valorant events again, please fill out this form. [https://forms.gle/z16dbk4mzrMqoxYG7](https://forms.gle/z16dbk4mzrMqoxYG7)

_We will be closing submissions towards the end of September._

## CONCLUSION

With the event drought drying up, we hope that you are excited for what we have in store for the rest of 2022 and hope to see you on the field or on Twitch chat.

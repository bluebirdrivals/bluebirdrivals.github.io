Hello Everyone,

Last Friday was the conclusion of the first season of the Mini League, where we saw Max’s Rancid Rats take out the whole tournament undefeated. Hazard had put up a good fight against the rats, taking them to game five in the Grand Final. We would like to extend a personal thank you to everyone involved in the first season of Mini League. In this post, we will be providing details on the Mini League Season 2 and some of the more permanent changes that we are making to the Weekly Bash.

## Mini League Season 2

After seeing the potential that has come from the first season of the ‘Mini League’, we are back for the second season of the 'Mini League’, starting on the 18th of September with the qualifiers. For those that don't know what the Mini League is, it is a structured, short league for the top 6 to fight for their share in the $250 AUD prize pool. Each season will operate in a 5-week cycle, to provide that consistent and refreshing experience.

## About the Mini League (Season 2)

### Format

6 teams will qualify for the Mini League season from The Weekly Bash’s #6 and #7 (Top 3 from each week).

-   2 Weeks - Qualifiers from Challengers Division (Top 3 Qualify Each Week)
    
-   2 Weeks - Mini League Play  
    
    -   Single Round Robin (Bo5)
        
-   1 Week - Top 4 Finals  
    
    -   Gauntlet Format (Bo5)
        
### Team requirements

Team Logo (if not provided, a generic logo will be used)

Team Captain

### Roster

A team roster must consist of at least 3 members.

Teams must keep 2/3rd of the core roster used in the qualifiers.

Any roster change made, will be subject to admin approval.

### Additional Notes (Changes are in bold)

-   If a team qualifies during Week 1 of qualifiers, then they cannot play in week 2 of the qualifiers.
    
-   1 game per round will be streamed on the BlueBird Rivals Twitch channel.  
    
    -   _For games that aren’t streamed on the main broadcast, we will be partnering with community streamers that will cover those games._
        
    -   _Additionally, that will mean that replays for every game played will be available._
   
-   After the season is concluded, every team will have to requalify for the next season.
    
-   Season 2 will last for a period of 5 weeks.
    
-   Any team that qualifies for the Mini League will now have to accept an invite from the admin team, so they are fully aware of the schedule and can commit to it.

## Weekly Bash Changes

During ‘The Weekly Bash’ #4 and #5, we announced that we were trialing a series of changes with the goal of making ‘The Weekly Bash’ fairer and more enjoyable for everyone. These were the following trials that were announced.

-   In the Weekly Bash #4, the playoff format is now a double elimination, with lower-seeded teams starting in the lower bracket. For the Weekly Bash #5, there will be no round-robin group stage and will only be a Double Elimination format.
    
-   The top 20 teams (and players of those teams) in the Liquipedia OCE ratings will now be barred from entering the Amateur Division.
    
-   Any team which places highly in the Amateur Division may be automatically promoted to the Challengers Division the next time they enter any of our events.
    
-   For the Challengers Division, established teams will now be seeded using the Liquipedia ratings.
    

After some deliberation, we have decided to make the following changes;

-   The format for The Weekly Bash #6 and #7, will revert back to a 2 stage tournament, where the first stage is a BO3 round robin with teams of up to 4 per group, and the top 2 from each group will progress to the BO5 single elimination playoffs (with a third-place tiebreaker for Challengers Division).  
    
    -   _We decided that we still need to do some finetuning to provide an excellent format for the players to play in while balancing it for a consistent broadcast experience (especially during Qualifiers). We may be doing further trials from the Weekly #8 - #10 and hope to find a good experience for both the players and stream while not impacting the duration of the tournament._
        
    

-   The top 25 teams (and players of those teams) in the Liquipedia OCE ratings will now be barred from entering the Amateur Division.  
    
    -   _We have decided to up this from the original top 20 team, after some further analysis on the rankings and the skills of those teams._
        
    -   _Any individual from the top 25 teams wanting to participate will need admin approval to participate._
        
    -   _We will still be using our discretion to determine if a player or team is appropriate for the Amateur Division._
        
    

-   Any team which places highly in the Amateur Division may be automatically promoted to the Challengers Division the next time they enter any of our events.  
    
    -   _This remains unchanged from the trials._
        
    

-   For the Challengers Division, established teams will now be seeded using the Liquipedia ratings.  
    
    -   _This remains unchanged from the trials._
        
    

## Conclusion

We can't wait to see what the second season of the Mini League brings, in terms of play and we hope you enjoy these changes to the Mini League and The Weekly Bash. As per always, we do take into consideration the feedback that people do give us and are vital to providing you with a better event experience. Therefore, if you have any feedback (or compliments in that case), please let us know.

We will have the registration announcement for the Weekly Bash #6 ready tomorrow night on our Discord server.

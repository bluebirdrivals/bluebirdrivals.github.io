In the Summer, we ran a circuit that was all over the place, with multiple issues plaguing the circuit but it also had its moments such as Forbidden Gaming creating a new kickoff meta or the Rats being ever dominant (too bad, be we couldn't show them winning both the Mid-Season Brawl and Summer Brawl Finale).

That's why for the rest of Autumn, it's time for us to go 'back to basics, where gone are the confusing formats, leaderboards and most importantly, double round robins. In place, we have the Autumn Blitz, a month-long circuit filled with 4 qualifier events (through our Weekly Bash events) and a $300 AUD Finale. This will run from April 30th to May 28th with just one night of the week to remember, FRIDAY NIGHT!

## Qualifiers
_Weekly Bash #31-34 (April 30 - May 21)_
During the timespan of this circuit, our Weekly Bash events will be used as qualifiers for the Finale and to make things simple for everyone, the team that wins, will qualify straight to the finale (assuming they meet the eligibility requirements for a qualification spot). That's right, there are no more leaderboards, meaning that it's all or nothing.

## Finale
_Autumn Blitz Finale (May 28)_
The 4 qualified teams from the 'Weekly Bashes' will join 4 invited teams in a classic Double Elimination tournament battling it for their share in the $300 AUD prize pool. In a first for BlueBird Rivals, the finale will feature a player based seeding system, meaning that only the players will have themselves to blame for the seeding if it goes wrong. The finale will also feature a brand new broadcast experience for our viewers to tune in and stay engaged. There will be hard battles to be played out and only one team at the end of the night can declare themselves the Autumn Blitz victors and join Max's Rancid Rats as a BlueBird Rivals seasonal circuit victor.

## More Details
For more details (including the rule book, format and etc) be sure to check out [https://www.bluebirdrivals.org/autumnblitz](https://www.bluebirdrivals.org/autumnblitz/) and we'll be announcing our invited teams on there and our social media pages.

We can't wait to see you on the field (or on stream).

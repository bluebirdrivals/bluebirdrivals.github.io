The top 4 teams have been decided for Winter Brawl Finale, Shamisen, Sad Again, Redbird and Rancid Rats Reborn. With how dominant Shamisen have been, the other teams will really need to step it up coming into the knockout round to be able to come out on top and become the Winter Brawl champion.

## Shamisen (1st Seed)

Shamisen have been the dominant team in this tournament, holding top of the ladder since week 1. They are going to be the team to beat having amazing shooting accuracy of 40%, whether it be from solo mechanical plays, the perfect pass or the decisive team plays, Shamisen will put any defence under pressure. Speaking of defence, they have the least shots taken against them, their opponents must get creative to even get a shot on net. With their dominance they will be the team to beat coming into the final stage.

## Sad Again (2nd Seed)

Keeping scores close and weathering attacks is Sad Again’s game. They are a defensive team who can withstand a hammering from any opposition attack. This wall of a team will never let games get out of reach, always making it difficult for any team to have a runaway game. With a solid defence they will surely be looking to improve their offensive capabilities if they hope to take out this tournament.

## Redbird (3rd Seed)

We’ve only seen 2 series from Redbird but they are looking like a very solid team. With a solid shooting percentage of 35% and saving nearly half the shots on goal it will be up to Redbird to prove they are the top team on the day.

## Rancid Rats Reborn (4th Seed)

The team best described as the Chaos crew, having both the highest number of shots and the highest number of shots against them, they certainly like to make things interesting by playing fast and loose, with delusioN at the helm. Having 57 saves and forcing 54 saves against across 3 series they like to keep up the pace and push the other team’s tempo. If the Rats can outpace the opposition and keep their own rotations solid, they will be able to come out on top.

As we drive on through to the Finale it will be up to the teams remaining to prove that they are the best. All the teams will be looking to hone their skills and sure up their weaknesses, making for the most exciting end to the tournament.

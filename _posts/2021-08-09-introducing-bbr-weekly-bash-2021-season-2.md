It has been a year (to the day) since the 'Weekly Bash' series (originally dubbed 'The Weekly Bash') was announced and it has been through a lot. It was originally formed as a event that operated on a 5 week cycle and contained the Mini League for those that qualified and since then, changed quite a bit with the most recent change being the serialised format. With this being the one year anniversary of the Weekly Bash Series, we will be making this season quite special.

## ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ A Season of Celebration ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³
The first way we will be celebrating the Weekly Bash on year anniversary will be by increasing the prize pool for this season only! The Finale prize will increase from **$150 AUD** to **$300 AUD**, while the qualifier events will be increased from **$30 AUD** to **$45 AUD**.

But that's not the only way we're celebrating as we're in the season of giving away as well. We will be doing multiple giveaways throughout the season with full details to be announced in the coming days. But expect there to be a weekly giveaway on our livestream, where we giving away randomised Rocket League item packages and a bigger giveaway that will go throughout the whole season.

## Rulebook Changes
We have also decided to review the rulebook and tweak some some rules and make our unofficial changes, more official.

**Qualification Spot**

In the last season, we had received some feedback on the way that we handle the ban on already qualified players/teams not being able to participate on the final week of qualifiers.

We will now allow players that have left an already qualified roster (and have notified an admin) prior to the start of the start of the final qualifier to play now. However if they fail to qualify in the final week, they cannot join the original roster they left.

We have also now made it so that if a player that have left an already qualified roster (and have notified an admin) prior to the start of the start of the current qualifier they're playing in, they are now also an eligible to qualify to the finale.

We will be reviewing this rule and work on adjusting it over time to make it more clearer and easier to understand, so keep an eye out.

**Coaches**

While officially, there were no spectators allowed besides approved members of the BBR event and broadcast teams, we have unofficially have been allowing coaches to spectate their team's games under the condition that both teams are okay with it.

We are now making this official a rule, where coaches are now allowed to spectate their team's lobbies. However they cannot spectate the lobbies in some circumstances such as the opposing team prohibiting coaches in lobbies or if the match is slated as a streamed match.

**3rd Party Broadcasters**

In the past we have received requests from community streamers/orgs if they could stream/cast their team's matches and because of our rulebook only allowing BBR staff and broadcast team to be in the lobbies, we could not allow 3rd party broadcasters to cast/watch their team's matches.

We are currently working on setting up an approval process, so we can allow 3rd party community streamers to stream their team's path in our tournaments with some rules and restrictions. More details will come out in the coming weeks.

Also just to be clear, players have always been allowed to stream their own POVs.

For more details on the changes, we have please check out the rulebook or faq section [found here](https://www.bluebirdrivals.org/weeklybashseason2).

## One More Thing

For the first ever time, we'll be running a **1v1 event series** during this season of the Weekly Bash. This series is a 3 part series filled with **two qualifiers** and **a finale**. Each qualifier will be a **double elimination** tournament featuring a **$20 AUD prize pool** and **2 Finale spots** (4 Finale spots in total).

The Finale will feature **4 qualified players** and **4 invited players** battling it out in a **player seeded double elimination** tournament fighting for their share in the **$150 AUD prize pool**.

**1v1 Dates**

Depending on how this 1v1 series goes, we may start to include some non 3v3 events into our event schedule or maybe look into running hybrid region events (e.g. OCE/Asia Maritime).

Today (24/09/21) marks 174 weeks (or 1,218 days) since we ran our very first ever Friday night event with the second edition of the Viking Shield and since then a lot of people have given up their Friday nights to put on a great event for everyone to play in, through our various event series. With the recent announcement of the RLCS 2021/2022 season, means that we have to find a new day to host our events and also make radical changes to our plans for the rest of the year.

## TUESDAY NIGHTS
The community has decided on what night we should move to and we have settled for Tuesday nights to be our new night.

## WEEKLY BASH - FINAL SEASON

### SEP 28 - OCT 26
The first radical change we had to make is to fast track the retirement of the Weekly Bash series (we were planning to do this at the end of November) and put on one last season of the Weekly Bash. We plan to replace the Weekly Bash with something new next year. This final season of the Weekly Bash will be a pathway into the Spring Brawl that will happen.

### Qualifiers Key Details
-   Tuesday Night (Sep 28 - Oct 19)
-   Winner of each Qualifier progress to the Finale + wins the $30 AUD Prize Pool
-   2nd-8th Place will earn qualification points and the top 4 from that will progress to the Finale.
-   6:30 PM AEST Start Time (Subject to change for Daylight Savings)
-   Double Elimination Groups to Single Elimination Playoffs
    -   _This format was chosen due to time constraints and having to cater for many timezones, once Daylight Savings hits. This is also subject to change depending on community feedback._
        
### Grand Finale Key Details
-   Tuesday Night, Oct 26
-   8 Teams
-   Double Elimination
-   Top 4 will qualify for the Spring Brawl

The event and registration page will come out this weekend.

## SPRING BRAWL

### NOV 2 - NOV 30
It's now that time of year to do a bit cleaning and get your skills on point because the Spring Brawl is coming in November. We are currently in the final stages of planning the Spring Brawl but we can share some key details of event (but keep in mind this is subject to change).

### Premier Stage (Nov 2 and 9)
This will be two weeks of action between the 4 teams from the Weekly Bash Grand Finale and 4 invited teams to determine which 4 will progress directly to the finale and which 4 will have to play in the 'Wildcard Tournament'.

### Wildcard Qualifier (Nov 2 and 9)
While there is no direct pathway into the Premier Stage, there is still a pathway in to the Spring Brawl Finale. During the same time period as the Premier Stage we will be running two Wildcards Qualifiers and the top 2 from each qualifier will progress to the Wildcard Tournament.

### Wildcard Tournament (Nov 16)
It's a battle between the 4 qualified teams facing the bottom 4 teams from the Premier Stage to determine the final 2 teams that will make it to the Finale.

### Finale (Nov 23 and 30)
The final 6 teams will compete in a custom double elimination bracket over the final two weeks of November and versus each other for their share in the $600+ AUD prize pool (this may increase by the time it is finalised).

We will have more to say about the Spring brawl in the coming weeks.

## DECEMBER?
We have nothing planned at the moment for December but if a large amount of the community wants us to put on something during this time period, you shall receive something from us.

## 2022?
January 1st, 2022 is when you shall expect to hear our plans for the new year.

## FINAL NOTES
We will have the event page for the final season of the Weekly Bash ready this weekend and we will announce the finalised details of the Spring Brawl in the coming weeks. We look forward to these changes and we hope to see you turn up on Tuesday nights.

p.s. We have one more BBR announcement to make tomorrow.

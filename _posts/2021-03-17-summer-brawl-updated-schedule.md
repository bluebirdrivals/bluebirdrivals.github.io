With the second half of the circuit underway now, we have decided to make some tweaks to the schedule. Here are the updated dates for the rest of Summer Brawl Circuit:

![ ](/assets/postimg/2post_summer_brawl_updated_dates.png)

## WEEKLY BASH

Weekly Bash #25 was the last chance for **Newcomer teams to earn points for the Newcomer Mini Brawl**. We are currently in the process of inviting the qualified teams to the Newcomer Mini Brawl.

For the **Standard teams**, **we have added one extra event** to earn points for the Summer Brawl Finale. You can see the current standings here: [https://bit.ly/SummerBrawlStandings](https://bit.ly/SummerBrawlStandings) .

Registrations for the Weekly Bash #26 are now open: [https://smash.gg/WeeklyBash26](https://smash.gg/WeeklyBash26)

The Weekly Bash **will NOT run on the 26th of March** but will comeback on the **2nd of April** for the **standard division only**.

## SUMMER BRAWL PREMIER

Last Monday we made the call push back for the second round-robin to be pushed back by a week, meaning that Group A played on Monday the 15th of March. Group B will play a week after with tiebreakers to be played out a day after each group’s completion if needed.

## NEWCOMER MINI BRAWL

The Newcomer Mini Brawl will run as planned and with no changes to the schedule.

**Newcomer Mini Brawl Details**

The Newcomer Mini Brawl will take the top 6 teams from the Newcomer points leaderboard and they will battle it out in a single round-robin, whereby the top 4 will then progress to a gauntlet final.

The gauntlet final will feature a prize pool of $75 AUD, where first place will get $60 AUD and second place will get $15 AUD.

## SUMMER BRAWL FINALE

The delay, we made to the second round robin of the Summer Brawl Premier meant we had to push back the dates for the Summer Brawl Finale as well. The **Dominance Tiebreakers and Wildcard Qualifiers** will run simultaneously on **Friday 26th of March**. **The finals** will run on **Saturday the 3rd and Sunday the 4th of April**. The Dominance Tiebreakers will be a streamed event, while the Wildcard Qualifiers will be off-stream (or handed to community streamers).

The Wildcard Qualifier event has also received some additional changes as a result of AHHHHH's disbandment. Chung (as they have placed 4th place from Group A) has automatically qualified to the finals as the 7th seed, and **the amount of teams that will qualify to the finals from the Wildcard Qualifiers will be reduced from 2 teams down to 1 team,** with that team taking the 8th seed.

## POST SUMMER BRAWL CIRCUIT

After the Summer Brawl Circuit concludes, we will only be running the **Weekly Bash (Standard Division only)** for a couple of weeks, to let the team relax from the whole circuit. We will be announcing our plans for the Autumn circuit either on the Finals of the Summer Brawl Finale or after it. Expect our Autumn circuit to not last as long as the Summer Brawl and we’ll be consulting with the community to work on a refined and better circuit for the Winter.

For the Newcomer division, we’ll be **temporarily pausing the division** (for the Weekly Bash) until there is enough demand for a second division and/or if we can come up with a new way to reinvent the division.

tldr - Dates for the rest of the Summer Brawl Circuit has changed (look at graphic), one team will from the Wildcard Qualifier will now make it to finals, an extra Weekly Bash has been added and the Newcomer division will be temporarily paused for our weeklies only.

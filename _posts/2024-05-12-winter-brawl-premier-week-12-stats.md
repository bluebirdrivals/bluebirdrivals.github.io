We go into an exciting week 3, seeing teams start to solidify their spot on the table and others look to climb their way up. Many of these teams will be looking for their players to shine and step it up in the second half of the Premier Stage to get a top 4 finish to make it into the playoffs. With that being said let’s look at who is performing as far as goals, assists, and saves.

## GOALS

### Finn from SHAMISEN

With a highly respectable 1.50 goals per game Finn have been the best performing striker so far, racking up 9 in 6 games played. Teams will surely need to look at stopping Shamisen before getting they can get the ball to Finn with a staggering 50% shooting percentage this player is surely to find the back of the net whenever they can.

## ASSISTS

### Kaka from SHAMISEN

Not to be out done by Finn, Kaka is leading the Winter Brawl in assists per game with 1.67. If pressure isn’t kept on Kaka, you can be sure they will find the cracks in the defence. With a total of 10 assists across 6 games and an offensive positioning time of 39% Kaka will always be looking for that opening he can give a teammate.

## SAVES

### Crazy from EMBOURGEOISEMENT

Coming in with the highest average saves is Crazy with 2.12. Taking a closer look at the positioning of Crazy, they spend the average amount of time in defence, compared across all players, allowing them to be a reliable all-rounder who knows when to be in the correct position especially when it comes to defence. Crazy should become a pillar of strength for Embourgeoisement in the coming weeks as they look to solidify a top 4.

With 2 weeks completed and 2 more weeks left to go, who will be the 4 teams to make it through to the finale?

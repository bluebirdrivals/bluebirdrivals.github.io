Get your !donate ready, because BlueBird Rivals, Game On Cancer®️ and RIG Gaming have joined forces to bring the Rocket League spectacle BACK and raise money for cancer research as a 2 night spectacle featuring a $500 AUD prize pool, among other goodies.

Night one is the open qualifier event, where teams will be battling it out for a top 2 spot for the main event. Night two is the main event, where the two qualified teams will join 4 invited teams to battle it out in a double elimination bracket and fight for their share in the $500 AUD prize pool.

Throughout the night we'll have some goodies for when we reach a particular donation goal (we be announcing them shortly in our social media accounts).

As we head into the middle of the Summer Brawl Premier, we will see the top 3 teams of each group go head-to-head in the Mid-Season Brawl. With $250 AUD up for grabs, this will be an exciting tournament to watch as every team will be sure to bring their best to come out on top.

But before we can head into talking about the Mid-Season Brawl, we first have to break down what happened in the first round robin.

Group A saw a very clear picture of the strong and weak teams in the group if you looked only looked at the series win/loss record. However, when you take a closer look at it, it is so much closer than it seems, with all but one series going to a game 5. Despite all of their games going to a game 5, Brain Chasers looks very strong being the only team SO FAR to be undefeated in the Summer Brawl Premier and it will be interesting to see how this team filled with talent performs against teams of Group B.

Group B all came down to a one-game difference to determine the 1st/2nd and 3rd/4th tiebreakers. We saw Mako come out on top followed by Max’s Rancid Rats, AHHHHH then Hazard currently sitting last. One of the interesting match-ups was between Mako and Max’s Rancid Rats, where it was a rematch decider match from the final Mini League season playoffs. We saw Mako being the one to take themselves to series point in game 3 but the rats were able to pull through in the final two games, and just edge out Mako.

Despite Chung and Hazard Esports not making it to Mid-Season Brawl, do not discount them as they still have a strong chance of making through directly through the Finals stage of Summer Brawl Finale if their overall standings improve after the second round robin.

## Qualified Teams

## Brain Chasers (Group A Seed 1)

With great team plays and high mechanical skill, this team won’t be easily beaten as shown in the first round-robin taking out all 3 series to come out as Group A’s 1st seed. It’ll be interesting to see how Brain Chasers stack up against the teams from Group B.

### Highlight Player

Bananahead has been a standout player from Brain Chasers and the tournament with fantastic mechanics and 1v1 outplays seen in the first round robin makes this player any defence's worst nightmare.

## Mako (Group B Seed 1)

All the players on this roster have the ability to perform in any position. With the talent and versatility of this roster, it’s going to be hard to beat them for any team, considering their performances in recent events and even back in the final season of the Mini League last year.

### Highlight Player

Morse has proven to be a versatile player for Mako filling into any position on the rotation whether that is defence, offence, or sweep, he is always ready to make an impact.

## Fractal Esports (Group A Seed 2)

With their only loss being to Brain Chasers, Fractal Esports have been playing their own game and capitalising on the opposition's mistakes making them the 2nd seed from their group.

### Highlight Player

Joshuadx7 has been a big source of defensive power for this team. Having some of the highest averages saves a game has helped him become a saviour for Fractal Esports leading them to be 2nd seed.

## Max’s Rancid Rats (Group B Seed 2)

Despite being second seed (by a single game difference), Max’s Rancid Rats is one of the strongest teams in this competition. Having won the first three seasons of the Mini League, going back to back to back and being the runner-ups in the final season, there is a reason that they are so strong and dominant.

### Highlight Player

SSteve is a player to keep an eye on in any series with great decision making and mechanics to back it up makes him hard to get past in the midfield and is a danger on the offence never afraid to go for the demo and get the opposition flustering.

## Good and Useful (Group A Seed 3)

Being one of the more aggressive teams in the competition Good and Useful has been competitive against the other teams in their group taking them to all 5 games in all their series’. This team will be one to look out for to take some surprising wins.

### Highlight Player

MrShoeShoe has led this team as their most aggressive player taking the shots as they come testing the enemy’s defence. Be sure that Shoe will be scoring if the defence gives even an inch.

## AHHHHH (Group B Seed 3)

Despite being the 3rd seed from their group, AHHHHH have shown that when they are on the same page they are up there with the best of them as they took a series off of Max’s Rancid Rats giving the rats their only series loss of the first group stage.

### Highlight Player

In their series win, Scout was a big part of the win getting an impressive 45% shooting accuracy. If Scout can bring this accuracy to all his future games he will be a scary offensive player for any of these teams to defend against.

With these exciting players and many more hitting the field this weekend it will be a thrilling series of matches to find the best team for the Mid-Season Brawl.

Happy New Year!
Along with many changes to Nordic Gaming throughout the last year, came both successes and drawbacks, but it was you guys and gals who joined us along the way.
To kick off the new year, we have an exciting announcement to share... As of today (January 1st 12:00 AM AEDT) our partnership with BlueBirdRP will grow from a one off event, into a full co-company existence.

What does this mean for Nordic Gaming?
Nordic Gaming has been looking into changing our name and doing a rebrand for some time. After the success of the first BlueBird Cup, BlueBird have decided to purchase us, "Nordic Gaming". This means that moving forward, we will be known as "BlueBird Rivals"!

What is going to change?
At it’s core, nothing. This acquisition has come with a great level of freedom to do what we do best. The things that will change will be what we are able to achieve. With our acquisition by BlueBird also comes funding. This will allow us to pursue events we had only hoped to do in the past. We will be releasing a full schedule of events for 2020 soon. In terms of Rocket League events, you won’t have to wait long, as the first event starts in January with our BlueBird Weekly Cups, with the BlueBird Rivals Circuit coming shortly after. Stay tuned for an announcement for our Teamfight Tactics events.

What we would like from you.
The only thing we can ask of all of you is to come along with us on this new journey. You will be seeing a lot more information soon regarding where our new home is going to be. BlueBird have some great forums set up that we will use to further explain everything. They also have a tonne of support options available, and these will allow us to put on bigger events than ever before!

We hope you have a happy new year and stay safe, enjoy the time with the ones you love...

TDLR;
Nordic Gaming is now BlueBird Rivals, weekly events starting up soon, details on BlueBird Rivals Circuit and TFT events coming soon.

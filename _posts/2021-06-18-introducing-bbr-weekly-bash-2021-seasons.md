subtitle: The all new Weekly Bash format...
description: It's almost been a year since the 'Weekly Bash' series (originally
  dubbed 'The Weekly Bash') has formed and it has been through a lot. It was
  originally formed as a event that operated on a 5 week cycle and contained the
  Mini League for those that qualified and since then, we had used the Weekly
  Bash for our qualifiers for the Summer Brawl Premier, then was used a points
  leaderboard for the Summer Brawl Finale and then was recently used for the
  qualifiers for the Autumn Blitz Finale and was apart of the overall Autumn
  Blitz circuit. We enjoyed the way that the Autumn Blitz operated so much, that
  we have decided to spin-off that format and make our Weekly Bash events a
  STANDALONE series, where it utilise that format with some tweaks to it.

The all new Weekly Bash Seasons is a recurring serialised tournament filled with 4 weeks worth of qualifiers and a monthly finale, similar to the Autumn Blitz circuit with a few changes. The qualifiers will remain exactly the same for the season, however the Finale will get some changes. No longer will there be any invited teams, meaning this is pure top 4 final with only those that have grinded they way. Also the TOTAL finale prize pool will be $150 AUD with first place getting $120 AUD and second place getting $30 AUD.

We will be seeing how this new Weekly Bash performs and we will work on refining it, season by season based on your input (oh there will be more Weekly Bash surveys to come).

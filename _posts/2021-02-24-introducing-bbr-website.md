## Introducing bluebirdrivals.org

As a result of what happened on our Discord server the other day (we'll talk about it later in the post), we have decided to fast-track the development and reveal of our own standalone website.

bluebirdrivals.org will give us the ability and flexibility to create whatever content that we want with out having to be confined to a particular services format or having to use Google Docs or the BlueBirdRP's forums for our longer announcements.

Currently bluebirdrivals.org will have a heavy focus on article related content relating to more of our premier tier events and of course, the big major announcements we have (infact you can find most of our old (BlueBird Rivals related) announcements here already). We plan to add more features to this website such as making this website the definitive way of watching LIVE and previous BBR content and more.

We hope you enjoy the website and be sure to check here more often as we expand on the website. Also, we would like to hear your input from what you want see from this website, so please join our Discord server and message someone from the management team with your input.

## Update on the BlueBird Rivals Discord Servers
On Monday night (22/2), a staff member had their Discord account compromised and while it was compromised, our main and staff Discord servers had been nuked, while it was not as bad it could've been, it was enough damage to take away from us working on other things especially with the Mid-Season Brawl coming up really soon. We have completed our investigation and action has been taken, though we would like to only keep this information private as it is a complex matter.

Today (24/2) we can say that we have rebuilt the essential elements of our main server, however the data in key channels and a large amount of special roles are gone (though we will work on slowing re-making and giving out the special roles that people had). As we were able to get the Discord server back and running this quickly, there will be no impact to our event schedule and events will run as planned. We in response to the situation have made the following changes (shown below) to reduce such risk from re-occurring.

### Changes
-   Only people in the management team will have full admin or moderation permissions.
-   For now, NO staff member (expect for management) will have the ability to delete channels, assign roles, invite bots and kick/ban members.
-   We will be following BlueBirdRP's approach to staff permissions whereby staff members will be given the permissions REQUIRED to do their duties instead of a blanket moderation permission (e.g. - Moderators can delete messages, mute people and drag people in voice channels).
-   Our Discord security will be continued to be worked on and expanded to reduce the risk of something like this happening again.
-   Everyone already in the server will be given the Rocket League role again, if you don't want the role please look at the # select-game channel.
-   We will diversify our online presence (with Facebook and other social media services coming soon) incase if a situation like this were to happen again then there can be back-up options for us.
-   We will also create a back-up log of all of our events, their champions and members with specials roles (e.g. - Casters, Donators and etc).
    

If you had a special role or if you're an inactive volunteer (who's roles have been removed), please message payback_theheist#0932 with some proof, so he can log it and give out the role when it's ready.

This has been something that has been in the works for over a year. We've kept an eye on Valorant as a potential esport title to expand into since it was known as 'Project A', with planning works under way for a really long time..

{% include youtube.html id="RphR6MIaAnY" %}

Today we're ready to open our arms and get to know the Valorant community with our first ever event, 'Frenzy Blitz', a two day tournament running on October 9 and 10, 4pm AEDT.

Day one will be a single round robin stage with up to four teams per group facing each other once and the top 2 from each group will progress to the next day. Day two will be single elimation bracket to determine who will win our first ever Valorant event and walk away with the top prize. The prize pool will be $300 AUD with a $21 AUD entry fee per team. Only 16 teams can be a part of this first ever event, so be sure to get in quick.

We can't wait to see what Valorant brings for us and if this year ends up showing potential for this game, then there lots to show for 2022.

**Hello Everyone,**

Last Friday was the conclusion of the second season of the Mini League, where we saw Max’s Rancid Rats be the back to back champions of the Mini League. Ex. Hazard who had taken out the Rats for the first-ever time in League Play, were unable to recreate that success in the final game, leaving that rivalry concluded with the Rats taking out ex. Hazard three series’ to one. We would like to extend a personal thanks to everyone involved in this season of Mini League, it was very exciting to see all of these teams play and compete. In this post, we will be providing details on the Mini League Season 3 with some very minor changes.

## Mini League Season 3

We are back for the third season of the 'Mini League’, starting on the 23rd of October with the qualifiers. For those that don't know what the Mini League is, it is a structured, short league for the top 6 to fight for their share in the $250 AUD prize pool. Each season will operate in a 5-week cycle, to provide that consistent and refreshing experience.

## About the Mini League (Season 3)

### Format
- 6 teams will qualify for the Mini League season from The Weekly Bash’s #11 and #12 (Top 3 from each week).
-   2 Weeks - Qualifiers from Challengers Division (Top 3 Qualify Each Week)
-   2 Weeks - Mini League Play
-   Single Round Robin (Bo5)
-   1 Week - Top 4 Finals
-   Gauntlet Format (Bo5)
    

### Team requirements
- Team Logo (if not provided, a generic logo will be used)
- Team Captain

### Roster
- A team roster must consist of at least 3 members.
- Teams must keep 2/3rd of the core roster used in the qualifiers.
- Any roster change made, will be subject to admin approval.

### Additional Notes (Changes are in bold)
**Qualifiers**
-   If a team qualifies during Week 1 of qualifiers, then they cannot play in week 2 of the qualifiers.
-   **For this season, we will not be having an official broadcast for qualifiers. Instead, if there are any interested community casters, then we will look to give them an opportunity to broadcast some of the qualifiers on their own Twitch channel.**
	-   _We wanted to give our broadcast team a two-week break to relax and cool down, after broadcasting for 10 weeks straight (technically 9 weeks). During this time, the broadcast team will focus on fixing up some of the minor production issues that have crept up during the second season of the Mini League that has resulted in delays for our players._
-   Any team that qualifies for the Mini League will have to accept an invite from the admin team, so they are fully aware of the schedule and can commit to it.
    
**League Play/Finals**
-   1 game per round will be streamed on the BlueBird Rivals Twitch channel.
-   _For games that aren’t streamed on the main broadcast, we will be partnering with community streamers that will cover those games._
-   _Additionally, that will mean that replays for every game played will be available._
-   After the season is concluded, **the top 2 teams will be invited to the next season of league play**.
-   _We will have more information on the Mini League Season 4 in the coming weeks._
-   Season 3 will last for a period of 5 weeks.

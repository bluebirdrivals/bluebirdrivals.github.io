Last week, we put out a very simple survey, asking our fans what their ideal start time and format would be. We would like to thank everyone for contributing to the survey (and those that gave us compliments ;) ) and we have certainly gotten some very useful data to provide a better Weekly Bash experience for everyone.

With updating the Weekly Bash, we wanted to focus on shortening the length of the event (as recently, it has been ending fairly late for our standards) and providing a better weekly experience with your feedback in mind (as our next circuit will depend on the Weekly Bash heavily).

## CHANGES

With that in mind, we have decided to make the following changes to the Weekly Bash and will be in effect until at least the end of May:

-   **Our new start time is now 6:30 pm AEST**
    -   Registrations will close at 6:10 pm AEST
    -   _From the survey data, there was a_ deadlock _tie between_ 6:00 pm _AEST and_ 7:00 pm _AEST with no clear majority (50%+ of responses), meaning that at our most recent staff meeting, we determined that_ 6:30 pm _AEST would be the middle ground compromise in regards to our start time._
    
-   **The format will remain double-elimination**
        -   However, there will be new changes to the 'best of' for some rounds.
        -   Upper Bracket: Rounds up to the 'Upper Semi-Final' will now be a Bo3. the 'Upper Semi-Final' and 'Upper Final' will be a Bo5. The 'Grand Final' will remain as a Bo7 with a ONE game advantage to the winner of the 'Upper Final'
        -   Lower Bracket: Will remain a Bo3 until the 'Lower Final', where that will be a Bo5
        -   _We felt like this was a necessary change to make, as to cut back on some time and make the event end earlier_
    -   _The double-elimination format was by far the most popular format (56.5%), so it made sense for us to stick with it and with the one change to the 'best-of', hopefully, it shouldn't end too late._
        
    

## CONCLUSION
If you don't agree with any of these changes, you will have another opportunity to speak your mind at the end of May with our 2nd Weekly Bash Survey.

Overall, we think that these two changes will go a long way in providing a better experience for our weekly events while trying our best to make sure, these events don't go too late. We hope to see you on the field (or our stream) on Friday nights.

p.s. We'll be announcing our Autumn Circuit really soon (so keep an eye out for that).

## BlueBird Rivals Summer Brawl
_A.K.A The Seasonal Circuits_

The Seasonal Circuits is BlueBird Rivals’ new year-long plan for 2021, designed to continue providing high quality and refreshing event experiences while providing the flexibility to adjust the seasons based on demand and needs. The Summer Brawl specifically is split into 4 components, ‘Weekly Bash’, ‘Summer Brawl Premier (SBP)’, ‘Summer Brawl Finale’ and ‘Newcomer Mini Brawl’.

The Summer Brawl Premier is a brand new structured premier tournament that features 8 teams split into two groups playing in a double round-robin league play stage. After a single round-robin has been completed, the top 3 from each group will meet each other in a $250 Mid-Season Brawl, where it does not affect their standings in the league play stage. Once the Mid-Season Brawl has concluded, the second round robin will then begin and that will determine the top 6 teams that will automatically qualify the Summer Brawl Finale.

For seven weeks, the ‘Weekly Bash’ will operate, so that teams qualify for the Summer Brawl Premier and can also earn points for the Summer Brawl Finale.

The Summer Brawl Finale is a 3-week event to determine the overall winner of the Summer Brawl. Occurring during the same period is Newcomer Mini Brawl is similar to the Mini League, whereby newcomer teams play in the Weekly Bash for points over a 4 week period then is now placed into a 3-week event, where it is similar to how the first three seasons of the Mini League operated.

With the conclusion of the Weekly Bash upon us, it's now the right time to talk about the final brawl of the year. The Spring Brawl circuit is our biggest event of the year and our most unique with a $750 AUD Prize Pool and multiple pathways to the Finale.

## Premier Stage
_Tuesday November 2 and 9_

For the first ever time, teams in Premier Stage will NOT have to go head to head in a traditional Round Robin format, but instead every game will matter as they will have to play in a double elimination groups (GSL Style). There will be 2 groups of 4 teams in this stage. In this format, it will be 2 wins and you're in the Finale or 2 losses and your in the Wildcard Tournament.

In addition to this brand new format for the Premier Stage, this will also be a fully exclusive stage where 4 invited teams and the top 4 from the Weekly Bash Grand Finale make up the teams for this stage.

## Wildcard Qualifiers
_Tuesday November 2 and 9_

For everyone else, they will have to test their skills in the Wildcard Qualifiers. We will be running 2 qualifiers during the same time period as the Premier Stage, where the top 2 from each qualifier will progress to the Wildcard Tournament and fight for the final 2 Finale spots.

## Wildcard Tournament
_Tuesday November 16_

The Wildcard Tournament will comprise of the bottom 4 teams from the Premier stage and the qualified teams from the Wildcard Qualifier. They will battle it out in a double elimination tournament to determine the final two teams for the Finale.

## Finale
_Tuesday November 23 and 30_

This final battle will split across two weeks as every game will be streamed with this custom double elimination format. The top seed from each group in the Premier Stage will have a second chance to reach the Grand Final, while it is do or die for every other team from the beginning. These teams will also be battling for their share in the $750 AUD Prize Pool.

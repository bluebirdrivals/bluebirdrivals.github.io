# AND STILL COUNTING FOR THE LOVE OF ESPORTS
Established in 2017 as Nordic Gaming, BlueBird Rivals has always been passionate about delivering the best grassroot events and developing a new generation of talent and players in the oceanic scene.
# OUR ORIGINS
During 2017, Nordic Gaming was originally formed to create the ultimate ladder tool and experience, with pizza nights formed to help test these tools and give a sneak peak into what Nordic Gaming was going to be about. 
In 2018, we had decided to expand into event organising scene to help fill the drought of community ran events in the Oceanic Rocket League scene with our weekly 'Viking Shield' and monthly 'Viking Raid' events. Event organising would become our primary focus for Nordic Gaming. 
In early 2019, we started to experiment with more types of events outside from the typical 'weeklies' sphere, with the 20 week long 'Asgard' event and the monthly 'The Voyage' events and more high quality events for the Oceanic esports scene. 
In late 2019, BlueBirdRP and Nordic Gaming had announced a partnership to run a series of events known as BlueBird Cup, with the Chiefs taking out the inaugural cup. After that first cup, BlueBirdRP had decided to acquire Nordic Gaming at the very start of the 2020 year and rebrand it into BlueBird Rivals and the rest is history.
